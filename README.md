# DAP-Model-Advanced-Operations
* A DAP design and implementation project for City of Vancouver mainly on the Data Enriching, Protection, Governance and Observability.
* This step involves the 4 major steps namely:
## Step 1: Data Enriching
* Data enrichment in data management is all about augmenting raw data with relevant context and information that provides more value for analytical purposes.
* This cleanses the data and transforms it to provide meaningful insights, which again are useful to make better decisions. 
## Step 2: Data Protection
* In AWS, one can protect sensitive data by encrypting it to protect its confidentiality and security.
* AWS KMS provides a centralized control point for encryption keys so that users can create, manage, and use them to perform encryption and decryption automatically and with control over access to the keys using IAM policies.
* It improves data protection to be compliant with security standards.
## Step 3: Data Governance 
* Data governance is the discipline for establishing, implementing, and maintaining the structure for data across the enterprise.
* This means defining data quality, privacy, security, and compliance with regulatory standard policies, roles, and procedures.
* Starting with creating access controls, auditing data usage, enabling encryption capabilities for your data, and using features such as AWS Glue Data Catalog for managing and cataloging metadata, data governance in AWS is a combination of setup, management, and maintenance.
## Step 4: Data Observability 
* The real-time performance and health of the data platform in the rental standards domain is visualized using the data observability dashboard displayed in AWS CloudWatch.
* A customized dashboard tracks key metrics, including bucket storage utilization, number of objects in buckets, and associated estimated charges, giving a full view of data operations.
